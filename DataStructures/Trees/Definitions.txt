1. The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.
2. The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf.



3. The height of a tree is a height of the root.
4. A full binary tree.is a binary tree in which each node has exactly zero or two children.
5. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, 
    except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible
